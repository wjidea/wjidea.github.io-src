Here below are the list of softwares I found to be very handy for applied bioinformatics. Most of the tools I listed here are open-source program.

- [PRANK](http://wasabiapp.org/software/prank/) - Codon sequence alignment
- [MAFFT](http://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/software/) - Multiple sequence alignment, similar performance to [MUSCLE](http://www.drive5.com/muscle/downloads.htm)
- [egglib](http://egglib.sourceforge.net/) - powerful tools for population genetics and genomics data analysis
- [Roary](http://sanger-pathogens.github.io/Roary/) - tool for pan-core genome study (bacteria primarily)
- [Prodigal](http://prodigal.ornl.gov/) - is bacterial genome annotation tool, which works seamlessly with Roary.
- [ete](http://etetoolkit.org/) - a nice phylogenomics tool kit with API to python
- [Bioconda](https://bioconda.github.io/) bioinfo software package manager and environmental manager
- [d-maps](http://d-maps.com/index.php?lang=en) high quality map images, multiple format supported
- To be continued
