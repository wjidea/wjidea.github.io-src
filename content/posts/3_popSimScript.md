A python script writen in OOP style to simulate population genetic dfrit and spontaneous mutation. Microsatellite markers were used as a surrogate to calculate genetic diversity across time/generations. 

This script is also part of the project for the MSU [CSE801](http://alproductions.us/CSE801/) class.
