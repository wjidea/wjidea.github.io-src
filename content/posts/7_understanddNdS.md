In sliding window genomics analysis, to calculate the genetic diversity index given the genome alignment window is becoming one of the most useful tools to scan for selection or adaptation signitures from genomics data. However, to understand and interpret the biological meaning are not always straight-froward. In this article, I will try to explain those common genetic indecies with my understandings.

Thoughts
random drift or natural selection?
Natural selections left markers to the genome to allow us to detect these evolutionary events happend millions years ago.

Selection signatures depend on type, age and strength of selection events. Natural selection acts in at least three modes: positive, purifying (also called stabilizing or negative, eliminating a damaging allele) and balancing selection (including heterozygote advantage and frequency-dependent selection).
