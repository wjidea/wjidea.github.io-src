Normally, there are a few major steps:  

* Reference genome assembly for non-model organisms, such as most of the filamentous fungi
* Genome alignment
	- it can be in many formats, phylip, MAF (maybe), VCF, even FATSA
	- need to specify the hierachy in the population samples, better to include a outgroup which will be convenient to calculate some statistics that require outgroup samples
* 

There are a couple of tools can be used for sliding window analyses. 

Common statistics:
