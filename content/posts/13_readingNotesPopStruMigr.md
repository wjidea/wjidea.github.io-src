#### General comments
* McDonald and Linde (2002) coined the term genotype flow to describe the migration of multilocus genotypes in asexually produced individuals. 
* For the sexually recombining species, tracking the movement of rare alleles, particularly when isolates with rare alleles are released for this express purpose (Bennett et al. 2007).
* Track of MLG may not apply to the marker with high mutation, becuase the convergent evolution , i.e. same genotypes arise multiple times, making it impossible to distinguish migrants from recent mutants.
* Studies of population structure are frequently aimed at estimating the degree of subdivision or genetic differentiation among subpopulations.

#### fixation index and gene diversity analysis
*	fixation index is the probabilityy that any two ramdomly sampled alleles in a population are identical by descent
* The counterpart of diploid heterozygosity in haploid will be gene diversity.
